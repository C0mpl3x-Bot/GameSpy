The concept of this project is to create a price comparison web app designed to enhance and
simplify the e-commerce experience, from the very hard-core gamers to the casuals. Price
comparison sites do exactly what their name implies: compare the price of goods and services
from a range of companies. This allows consumers to make sure they get a deal that's tailored to
them at the best price. In 2018, it was estimated that more than 11 million people used price
comparison sites and it's clear why they appeal. They have had an almost revolutionary impact,
allowing people to save time and access a wider range of products. <br>


We decided to aim for a smaller (but still quite massive) segment of that market - the video game
industry. The exact same principles apply, except the comparisons will only consist of games. The
web app interface on the customer side will offer fluidity and dynamic content types - features
that existing sites do not have. The inspiration for this concept derives from the will to reduce the
complexity and countless hours wasted searching for the cheapest games on the internet. With so
many options to choose from - consumers are dealt with the difficult task of finding the best deal
for them.
